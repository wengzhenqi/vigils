---

AI agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Zed, MCP clients, browser assistants) call tools, read
files, hit APIs, and paste into web UIs on your behalf. That power is useful — and risky.
**Vigils sits between your agents and the tools/data they touch**, and it is *local-first*:
your prompts, secrets, and audit trail never leave your machine.

```
   AI agent ──▶  ┌─────────────────── Vigils ───────────────────┐  ──▶  tools / data
 (MCP client)    │  redact → firewall → approve → sandbox → audit │       (MCP servers,
                 └───────────────────────────────────────────────┘        files, APIs, web)
```

## Why Vigils

Four guarantees, enforced locally:

| Guarantee | How |
|---|---|
| **See what the agent did** | Every tool call is recorded in a tamper-evident **SHA-256 hash-chained ledger** with full-text search. |
| **Approve risky actions first** | Destructive / sensitive calls pause for human review in an **Approval Queue**, with per-agent policy and scoped grants. |
| **Keep credentials out of prompts / logs / UI** | A **redaction engine** strips secrets and PII (hard-fingerprint rules + an optional ML ensemble) *before* text reaches a model, a log, or the screen. |
| **Contain & roll back** | The ledger is traceable end-to-end and the **sandbox runner is fail-closed by default** (Wasm + native + Linux Landlock). |

## Features

- **🔒 Tamper-evident audit ledger** — SQLite + SHA-256 hash chain; every event links to the
  previous one, so tampering is detectable. FTS5 full-text search over the redacted trail.
- **🛡️ Default-deny firewall** — tool calls are gated by a Rust policy DSL; per-agent rules;
  OAuth scope allow-lists for remote MCP. Nothing runs unless allowed.
- **✅ Human-in-the-loop approval** — risky effects (file writes, network, destructive ops)
  pause for review. Grants can be scoped (once / this-session).
- **🙈 Secret & PII redaction** — hard-fingerprint detection for 13+ credential classes
  (GitHub PAT, Stripe keys, Google/GitLab tokens, DB URLs, …) plus an optional multilingual
  ML ensemble; a fail-closed merge layer decides what to mask.
- **🎟️ Secret lease broker** — short-lived credential leases injected only into the child
  process that needs them; plaintext is never persisted.
- **📦 Sandbox runner** — one-shot tool execution in Wasm (Wasmtime) or native processes,
  with **Linux Landlock LSM** filesystem isolation and `env_clear` so children don't inherit
  your environment. Fail-closed by default.
- **🔌 MCP gateway** — sits in front of MCP servers over **stdio and HTTP**; descriptor
  pinning with drift detection (alerts when a tool's definition changes); bare-command stdio
  upstreams (`npx`/`node`/`python`) resolve via host PATH before sandboxing.
- **🖥️ Desktop app** (Tauri 2 + Vue 3) — Approval Queue, Activity Feed, Server Registry,
  Session Replay, Privacy Findings; keyboard shortcuts, light/dark/system theme, real-time
  updates, bilingual (zh / en) UI.
- **🌐 Browser extension** (Chrome MV3) — redacts secrets/PII *before* paste or submit on AI
  sites (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity).

## Architecture

Vigils is a Rust workspace of focused crates plus three apps. Each layer is independently
testable and composed by the **Hub** (the MCP gateway).

| Layer | Crate | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| **Audit** | `vigil-audit` | SQLite ledger, SHA-256 hash chain, FTS5 search, redaction-scan records |
| **Policy** | `vigil-policy` | Rust policy DSL + rule engine (default-deny) |
| **Firewall** | `vigil-firewall` | Tool gating, per-agent rules, OAuth scope allow-lists |
| **Approval** | `vigil-mcp` (broker) | Human-in-the-loop, scoped grants, cross-process resolution |
| **Redaction** | `vigil-redaction` | Secret/PII detection (hard fingerprints + ML ensemble), fail-closed merge |
| **Leases** | `vigil-lease` | Short-lived credential leases, prepared child env (RAII revoke) |
| **Runner** | `vigil-runner` / `vigil-runner-types` | Native + Wasm execution, env policy, fail-closed |
| **Sandbox** | `vigil-sandbox-linux` | Linux Landlock LSM filesystem isolation |
| **Gateway** | `vigil-mcp` | MCP Hub: stdio + HTTP upstreams, descriptor pinning + drift |
| **Remote auth** | `vigil-http-auth` / `vigil-http-transport` | OAuth (JWT + opaque), token refresh (singleflight), real TLS |
| **UI protocol** | `vigil-ui-protocol` | Typed command/response contract for the desktop UI |
| **Browser** | `vigil-browser` | Redaction classifier + audit for the extension bridge |
| **SDK** | `vigil-sdk` | Thin, SemVer-stable facade over the engine |

**Apps & binaries:**

| Binary | Crate | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `vigil-hub` | `vigil-hub-cli` | CLI MCP gateway: `vigil-hub serve --stdio`, `add-remote-mcp`, `inspect`, … |
| `gui` | `apps/desktop` | Tauri 2 desktop app (embeds the Vue 3 UI + an in-process Hub) |
| `vigil-native-host` | `apps/native-host` | Native-messaging bridge for the Chrome extension |
| — | `extensions/chrome-mv3` | Chrome MV3 extension (vanilla JS, zero npm deps) |

## Installation

**Quickest** — install the CLI in one line, then jump to [Quick Start](#quick-start):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://vigils.ai/install.sh | sh         # macOS / Linux
```

```powershell
irm https://vigils.ai/install.ps1 | iex              # Windows (PowerShell)
```

Or grab a pre-built installer / binary for **Windows, macOS, or Linux** from any
[GitHub Release](https://github.com/duncatzat/vigils/releases):

| Platform | Desktop app | CLI |
|---|---|---|
| **Windows** | `.exe` (NSIS) / `.msi` | `vigil-hub.exe` (in `vigils-cli-windows-x64.zip`) |
| **macOS** | `.dmg` | `vigil-hub` (in `vigils-cli-macos-arm64.tar.gz`) |
| **Linux** | `.AppImage` / `.deb` / `.rpm` | `vigil-hub` (in `vigils-cli-linux-x64.tar.gz`) |

### Two redaction engines: hard-fingerprint (default) or ML

Both CLI builds run the identical firewall / audit / approval core — they differ only in the **redaction engine** that strips secrets and PII before text reaches a model, a log, or the screen:

| Build | Release asset | Redaction | First-run cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Default** — hard-fingerprint | `vigils-cli-<plat>` | 13+ structured credential & PII classes via fixed-pattern rules — deterministic, instant, no model | none |
| **ML** | `vigils-cli-ml-<plat>` | The above **plus** an OpenAI PII NER model + a DeBERTa prompt-injection classifier — broader, semantic PII (names, addresses, dates) and soft injection signals | bundles the ONNX Runtime dylib; fetches ~0.8–1.5 GB of models on first `--engine ml` run |

The two **coexist** — the engine is chosen per launch, so a single ML build serves any mode:

```bash
vigil-hub serve --engine hardfp   # fingerprint rules only (what the default build does)
vigil-hub serve --engine ml       # strict ML: fetches models on first run, fails closed if unavailable
vigil-hub serve --engine auto     # ML only if models are already cached and the dylib is present; otherwise degrades to hardfp and never downloads
```

Models are fetched from Hugging Face (primary) with a [vigils.ai](https://vigils.ai) mirror fallback, each verified by SHA-256 (fail-closed). The ML build bundles [ONNX Runtime](https://onnxruntime.ai) 1.24 next to `vigil-hub`. Platform floors for the **ML** build: **Linux glibc ≥ 2.28**, **macOS ≥ 14** — the default hard-fingerprint build has neither. _(ML builds ship from the next release onward; an earlier release may not include them yet.)_

> Early releases aren't OS-code-signed yet; your OS may show a Gatekeeper / SmartScreen prompt
> on first run — they're still independently verifiable (see below, or the full
> [Verifying your download](https://duncatzat.github.io/vigils/getting-started/verifying-downloads.html) guide).

**Verify what you downloaded** (optional). Every release asset carries a SHA-256 checksum
(`<file>.sha256`, also checked automatically by the one-line installer) and a cryptographic
**build-provenance attestation**. With the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com):

```bash
gh attestation verify vigils-cli-linux-x64.tar.gz --repo duncatzat/vigils
```

This confirms the artifact was built by Vigils' official CI from this repository (SLSA provenance
via Sigstore) — i.e. not swapped or tampered with after the build. The CLI archives, desktop
installers, and the extension zip are all attested. Full guide (per-OS steps + the unsigned-app
prompt): [**Verifying your download**](https://duncatzat.github.io/vigils/getting-started/verifying-downloads.html)
([中文](https://duncatzat.github.io/vigils/getting-started/verifying-downloads.zh-CN.html)).

The **Chrome extension** lives in `extensions/chrome-mv3/` — load it unpacked via
`chrome://extensions` → *Developer mode* → *Load unpacked* (it talks to `vigil-native-host`).

## Quick Start

### Install (one line)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://vigils.ai/install.sh | sh         # macOS / Linux
```

```powershell
irm https://vigils.ai/install.ps1 | iex              # Windows (PowerShell)
```

Installs the `vigil-hub` CLI (to `~/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Vigils\bin` on
Windows). It only puts the binaries on disk — **no shell/PATH edits, no `setup`, no agent-config
changes** — and prints what to do next, so you stay in control. The download is verified against the
release's published SHA-256 before unpacking (fail-closed). Want to read them first? They're
[`install.sh`](./install.sh) / [`install.ps1`](./install.ps1). Prefer a manual download? See
[Installation](#installation).

### See it in 60 seconds (zero setup)

One command shows Vigils' core value — **default-deny protection + reversible secret redaction +
tamper-evident audit** — running through the real runtime code, contacting no LLM, needing no account,
key, or network:

```bash
vigil-hub demo            # default-deny → placeholder round-trip → real value only at the local tool → audit with no plaintext
vigil-hub demo --tamper   # also: alter the audit ledger and watch verify-chain DETECT it (falsifiable)
```

What you'll see (real output, trimmed):

```text
  A demo secret — freshly generated locally for this run (never leaves this process):
    github_pat = ghp_c7da264c45f58cd89aaa12cde5b8c69883e6

  [1] default-deny: agent puts the RAW secret in the tool call
    tool=github.create_issue  ->  Vigil firewall: DENY  (rule=github_token)

  [2] the Vigil way: the agent passes a PLACEHOLDER instead
    What the REMOTE MODEL saw:    {"token":"secret://github_pat"}              plaintext secret? NO
    What the LOCAL TOOL received: {"token":"ghp_c7da264c45f58cd89aaa12c..."}   contains real value? YES
    The tool's result LEAKED a credential; Vigil re-redacted it:
      {"debug_trace":"authenticated with [REDACTED github_token] ...","ok":true}    secret back to model? NO

  [3] tamper-evident audit ledger (no plaintext secrets stored)
      0002 sha256:947ce1fe0d30  raw_secret_attempt_detected
      0008 sha256:17e875d2e47e  secret.leak_detected
    hash chain valid: YES        plaintext secret in audit: NO
```

> **The aha:** the agent did useful work with a real secret — while the model, logs, and audit never
> received the real value. It's a planted scenario with a freshly-generated local fixture; the
> firewall, redaction, and audit are Vigils' real code, only the model/tool provider is simulated.

### Protect Claude Code in one command (turnkey)

Download the release, then run **one command** to get fully protected. No manual config editing —
your existing settings are backed up and only Vigils' own entries are added (fully reversible):

```bash
vigil-hub setup --all       # protect everything, in one step
```

`setup --all` wires up **both** layers of protection:

1. **Native-tool input guard** — a Claude Code `PreToolUse` hook so **every tool call** (Bash,
   Edit, Write, Read, MCP tools, …) is checked before it runs; a real credential heading *into* a
   tool is **blocked fail-closed** and recorded in your tamper-evident audit ledger.
2. **MCP gateway** — routes each of your stdio MCP servers through Vigils so secrets in tool
   **results** are scrubbed before the model ever sees them, and every call is audited. It defaults
   to **monitor** posture — your servers stay fully usable while every hard protection stays on
   (raw-secret block, result redaction, tamper-evident audit). Add `--enforce` for default-deny gating.

```bash
vigil-hub setup --mcp --doctor    # pre-flight: will each wrapped MCP server actually start? (PATH check, read-only)
vigil-hub inspect protection      # after using your agent: see what Vigils caught (secrets blocked, leaks redacted, chain intact)
vigil-hub setup --all --uninstall # cleanly remove everything (your config restored byte-for-byte)
```

Restart Claude Code (or start a new session) and you're protected. This is the fastest path from a
GitHub download to real protection.

### As an MCP gateway (CLI)

Put Vigils in front of your MCP servers so every tool call is firewalled, approved, and audited:

```bash
# Serve as an MCP endpoint your agent connects to (stdio)
vigil-hub serve --stdio --upstream-config ./upstreams.json

# upstreams.json — bare commands resolve via PATH automatically
# { "upstreams": [ { "name": "fs", "argv": ["npx", "-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/data"] } ] }

# Register a remote (HTTP) MCP server with OAuth onboarding
vigil-hub add-remote-mcp https://mcp.example.com/

# See what Vigils has protected at a glance (secrets blocked, leaks redacted, audit chain intact)
vigil-hub inspect protection

# Inspect the local audit ledger from the command line (one-line JSON, pipe to jq)
vigil-hub inspect --db-path ./vigil.db activity --limit 20
```

Point your agent (Claude Code / Cursor / Zed) at `vigil-hub` instead of the raw MCP server. See
the **[Agent Integration & Test guide](https://duncatzat.github.io/vigils/getting-started/agent-integration.html)**
for per-agent config and how to verify it's gating.

### Desktop app

Launch the desktop app to watch and control agents in real time: **Approval Queue** (approve /
deny / bulk), **Activity Feed** (live audit stream), **Server Registry**, **Session Replay**,
and **Privacy Findings**.

## Build from source

Requirements: a recent **stable Rust** toolchain (see `rust-toolchain.toml`) and **Node.js 20+**
for the desktop UI. On Linux, Tauri needs GTK/WebKit dev packages.

```bash
# Workspace tests / lints (no GPU or model deps by default)
cargo test --workspace
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --all -- --check

# CLI gateway
cargo build --release -p vigil-hub-cli --bin vigil-hub

# Desktop UI + app (the `gui` feature embeds the built UI)
cd apps/desktop/ui && npm ci && npm run build && cd -
cargo build --release -p vigil-desktop --features gui --bin gui
```

> Crate names use the historical `vigil-*` prefix; the product and project are **Vigils**.

## Security model

- **Local-first** — prompts, secrets, and the audit ledger stay on your machine.
- **Default-deny** — the firewall blocks tool calls unless a policy explicitly allows them.
- **Fail-closed** — when a guarantee can't be enforced (e.g. Landlock unsupported, redaction
  engine unavailable but requested), Vigils refuses rather than silently degrading.
- **Tamper-evident** — the audit ledger is a SHA-256 hash chain; the desktop app can verify
  the whole chain.
- **No raw secrets at rest** — redaction stores only label / count / fingerprint metadata;
  plaintext credentials are never written to the ledger.
- **Least privilege spawning** — child processes get a cleared environment plus only the
  approved env and short-lived secret leases; Linux runs add Landlock filesystem isolation.

Found a vulnerability? Please report it privately — see [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md). Please
don't open a public issue for security reports.

CI runs the same gates on Linux and the UI build on every PR.

### Documentation (bilingual)

Vigils serves both the Chinese and international communities, so **user-facing docs are
bilingual**. When you add or change a guide / how-to / explanatory doc, evaluate whether it needs
both languages — if so, write an English page **plus a separate Chinese page** (never
sentence-by-sentence interleaving), e.g. `foo.md` + `foo.zh-CN.md`, cross-linked at the top.
Reference / ADR / internal docs may stay English-only.
